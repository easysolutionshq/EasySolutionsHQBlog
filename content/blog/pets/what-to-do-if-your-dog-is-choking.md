## Signs Your Dog Is Choking

The first step in helping your choking dog is to identify the signs. Common signs that your dog may be choking include:

## What To Do If Your Dog Is Choking

1.  Remain Calm: Your dog can sense your anxiety, and it may make them more anxious, making it harder to help them. Take a deep breath and try to stay calm.
    
2.  Open The Mouth: Gently hold your dog's mouth open and look for any foreign objects. If you can see the object and can reach it safely, try to remove it with your fingers or a pair of pliers.
    
3.  Heimlich Maneuver: If you cannot see the object, or it is too far down your dog's throat, perform the Heimlich maneuver. For small dogs, hold them with their head facing the ground and apply firm pressure to the abdomen just below the rib cage. For larger dogs, stand behind them and place your arms around their waist, applying pressure to the abdomen in an upward motion.
    
4.  Check The Mouth Again: After performing the Heimlich maneuver, check your dog's mouth again for any foreign objects. If you can see the object and reach it safely, try to remove it.
    
5.  CPR: If your dog is still not breathing, perform CPR. Lay your dog on their right side and start chest compressions by placing one hand over the other on the chest and compressing down gently.
    
6.  Seek Veterinary Help: Even if you were able to dislodge the object and your dog seems fine, it is still important to seek veterinary help. Your vet can check for any injuries or damage to the throat and make sure your dog is okay.
